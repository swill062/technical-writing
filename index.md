## “We are drowning in information, but starving for knowledge.” – John Naisbitt

Information has become increasingly accessible. Major platforms like Google make it almost ridiculously easy to get answers to questions that you might have had to wait a week or more for in the past. Thank goodness. But with this access, you would expect learning to thrive, however, it is not. We have all of this information right in front of us and we are not doing with it what we should. 

Why? Because the interest in reading is decreasing.

### What's Wrong:

Education often employs assignments involving analysis, reports, and presentations on information from required readings. Emphasis on “**required**”. That word alone is enough to deter most people from engaging as they should simply because they are being told they _HAVE_ to. 

Books and passages are no longer viewed as sources of learning but rather as a checkbox that must be marked to continue on in education. This mindset is completely limiting. 

There is so much that you can learn and gain from reading but only if you are willing to engage with the information – and that willingness is decreasing.

> In order to properly evaluate the problem, you must understand the nature of reading.

> Let’s look at it like this:

> On the surface, reading can seem to be just taking in or learning new information. But to be effective, you must take the information presented to you and interpret it in a way that is meaningful to you. It is an _active_ process.
>
> Education tends to take that personalization out of the picture. It is not a priority. As a result, **most people are not actually being educated**. 

### So What:

Why is it a problem that reading is decreasing? How does that affect you? Those are valid questions. 

Reading materials – books, articles, reviews, etc. – are all accumulations of people’s thoughts, actions, and emotions. People other than yourself. People who have already gone through the same situations that you might be facing. 

**If you could avoid making a mistake that someone else has already made, wouldn’t you?**

Mistakes can be personal and small, or large-scale and wide-reaching. Being able to avoid those mistakes gives you a competitive advantage in life. 

There is a common saying that “_you will not understand something unless you experience it yourself_”. What a piece of crap. Why spend your time and energy to go down a path on which others have experienced failure? 

Yes – you can learn from your own mistakes, but you can also learn from other’s mistakes. How do you do that?

By reading.  
 
### Now Get Going:

Logically speaking, the less mistakes you make, the more successful you will be. 

Reading a plethora of books and passages from a variety of fields increases the chance that you will find the piece of advice or tip that will bring you success. Don’t limit yourself. Spread your focus to multiple genres. I don’t want you to waste your efforts following only one or two avenues of data collection. 

If someone has already supplied the information that you need, then reading is the method through which you will find it. 

As the willingness to read decreases, its importance increases and the divide between those who read and those who don't becomes ever more apparent. Those who read for themselves have a significant advantage over those who don't, and I want you to succeed.

## Be a reader. It's that simple.
