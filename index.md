## “We are drowning in information, but starving for knowledge.” – John Naisbitt

Information has become increasingly accessible. Major platforms like Google make it almost ridiculously easy to get answers to questions that you might have had to wait a week or more for in the past. Thank goodness. But with this access, you would expect learning to thrive, however, it is not. We have all of this information right in front of us and we are not doing with it what we should. 

Why? Because the interest in reading is decreasing.

### What's Wrong:

Education often employs assignments involving analysis, reports, and presentations on information from required readings. Emphasis on “**required**”. That word alone is enough to deter most people from engaging as they should simply because they are being told they _HAVE_ to. 

Books and passages are no longer viewed as sources of learning but rather as a checkbox that must be marked to continue on in education. This mindset is completely limiting.
