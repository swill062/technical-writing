>“We are drowning in information, but starving for knowledge.” – John Naisbitt

Information has become increasingly accessible. Major platforms like Google make it almost ridiculously easy to get answers to questions that you might have had to wait a week or more for in the past. Thank goodness. But with this access, you would expect learning to thrive, however, it is not. We have all of this information right in front of us and we are not doing with it what we should. 

Why? Because the interest in reading is decreasing.
